### About this site
As gamers, we often look for fun new games to play. However, we've noticed that, while game reviews are helpful, they can be outdated and about different content releases. The reason we built our site is to have a more robust reviewing system that will allow users to create game reviews that are sorted by content release, whether it be major content releases, season changes or anything that changes the gameplay. This allows us to map the trajectory of the game as more content is release and helps gamers to pick games based on their current build.

## Current Build

- Add a game to the list.
- Create a game review and rate the game.
- Can only create one review per game.
- Others can add reviews and rate the games.
- Calculates the rating average from all the review ratings.

## Future additions

- Incorporate an api for a list of games so there will be multiple games already set for review.
- Add a graph to display the trajectory of the ratings for the games.
- When a content upgrade for a game comes out, it will lock all previous game reviews and allow new ones based strictly on the new content.
- Improve design of the site and add better transitions.
- Add featured games that have the most/highest reviews.
